<h3>Where to stay in Barcelona?</h3>
<p>
There are four areas to stay in Barcelona which are most
popular with tourists. These four areas are near central square Plaza Catalunya - or in Barcelonas old city called Ciutat Vella where you can find parts of the old gothic medieval city - or in the newer 19th century part of Barcelona called Eixample.Also popular in the summer are hotels near the beach. The old city is a little more vibrant and noisy, and great for walking around and exploring. The Eixample area has the bulk of the modernist architecture by Gaudi and is very charming.

<h3>Safety in Barcelona</h3>

Barcelona is a very safe city. It is safe to walk the streets both both during the day and night. The only part of Barcelona that can be a bit dangerous in the early hours of the morning are parts of the Raval area of BarcelonaÂ´s old city which should avoided in the early hours of the morning and especially if you are alone. 
But in general, Barcelona is still a very safe city and violent crime is rare. But Barcelona does have a lot of pickpockets and bag thieves in popular tourist areas, so take normal precautions to safegaurd your possesions.
